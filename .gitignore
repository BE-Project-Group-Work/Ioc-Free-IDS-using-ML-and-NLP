1. Ignore ALL data files
This single line ignores both the 'raw' and 'processed' subdirectories
and all of their contents.
/data/

2. Ignore ALL trained models
Model files are large and should be generated by running the train script,
not stored in the repository.
/initial_models/

3. Ignore ALL generated results
Images, plots, and other output files should be generated by the scripts.
/results/

4. Ignore ALL Jupyter Notebooks
Notebooks are for exploration. The final, clean logic is in the .py scripts.
/notebooks/

5. Ignore ALL testing data files
Sample files for prediction should not be part of the source code.
/testing/

6. Ignore Python virtual environments and artifacts
These are specific to each developer's machine.
pycache/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.env
venv/
env/
gpu_env/

7. Ignore OS-generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

8. Ignore obsolete/old directories from previous structures
This is good practice to keep the repo clean if these folders still exist.
/data_preprocessing_pipeline/
/initial_CLI_implementation/
